This method is based on the Intermediate Value Theorm (IVT), which (intuitively) states that for a continuous function, if there are two outputs that map to opposite sign values (i.e. one is positive and one is negative) then there must exist a value between the two that equates to zero. The following function $my\\_bisection$ uses IVT to estimate roots within a given tolerance level.First $a$ and $b$ are checked to have opposing signs to ensure a root exists between them. Next, the value of the midpoint between $a$ and $b$ is calculated for future evaluation using IVT. Then, for as long as the midpoint value falls outside of the accepted tolerance, the midpoint is continuously calculated to find the root, recursively using the previous midpoint as one of the bounds.\n",

With a lower tolerance for error, the second root found is more precise than the first. Because of this, when plugged back into the original function, the second estimated root is much closer to zero than the first."
